The aspect Ratio
if the  imag is 200x400 pixel
and you adjust the image wideth only to be 100
the height automatically will be 200 
cuz the aspect ratio of the image is 1:2

And this Work the same in the HTML



inline elemets can't have padding on the top or buttom
example  <span> 

to make it have padding on the top you have to change
the inline style of for example li
to inline block so it have padding top



you could use googel font 

when you write something like that
font-size: helvertica , monospace  it first try the first font family
if it doesn't exist it goes and try the next one

border-radius :50% makes a circule image
there is higher  proirity for id more than classes

the element padding  ; give space to the text in side the box.
magrin : give space around the box of element border of it.



Important : Negative Margin 

when u want to make controled marign you could put them in
same div so all margin to this div

anticlock wise   : 
20 40 60 80  top right bottm left when u make padding or margin

styling some html elements that has type attrbiute acroding to specific type

[type='radio']
{
css code\
margin:50px;
}
[type='checkbox']
{

margin:50px;
}


very very important tip

if we make style

.p1{
color:red;
}
.p2
{

color:blue;  !important
}
this order matter p1 came first then p2 overwritten it

<h1 class=" p1 p2 "> Mohamed Fathallah   </h1>
the order of writeing p1 p2 here in class attribute doesn't matter
what the goal here is that h1 could take style form those two classes but the last class over any same element in the first sytle
but id  will override anything if it came in any place


body > specific classes> other class override> id> inline sytle  those are the order of style override
the most powerfull thing is the !important

.p2
{

color:blue;  !important
}
this override even the inline style
background-color:
color 
# hex
or 
rgb()


there is css variables

Search USe Css variables to change several element at once

--mohmaed-color:black;
--mohamed-fontsize:25px;
how to use
backgound-color:var(--mohamed-color);
if something wrong happen we want to use backup color to be showen if variable doesn't like we did in the font-faimly
backgound-color:var(--mohamed-color,gray);

it's advantage when you change the variable it automatically change in all element that use this variable.


see the video  min 42  CSS Full course  codecamporg.com and try to use this idea ...


the variable is only avaiable to the elements that inside the parent element so you should but them in body for causal using
but to be more specific and professional it should be put into
:root
{


}
so it visible to all the element and you could overwite it as you wish

@media 
media queryies could be used to change variables
and makes change in the css depend on the size of the screen

search for 
CSS Grid
if we make 
the container of some element it's display to grid
