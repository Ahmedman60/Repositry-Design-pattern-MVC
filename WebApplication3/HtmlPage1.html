        governmental organizations use text messaging for communication 
        between colleagues. In the 2010s, the sending of short informal messages 
        has become an accepted part of many cultures, as happened earlier with emailing.[1]
         This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends, family and colleague
        s, including in contexts where a call would be impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very late a
        t night or when one knows the other person is busy with family or work activities). Like e-mail and v
        oice mail, and unlike calls (in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), texting does 
        not require the caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits communication even be
        tween busy individuals. Text messages can also be used to interact with automated systems, for example, 
        to order products or services from e-commerce websites, or to participate in online contests. Advertisers
         and service providers use direct text marketing to send messages to mobile users about promotions, payment du
        e dates, and other notifications instead of using postal mail, email, or voicemail.
